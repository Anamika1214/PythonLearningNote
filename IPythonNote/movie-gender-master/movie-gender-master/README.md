Data and code for analyzing Movie Lead Gender. This notebook is a complement to my blog post "Blockbuster Movies with Male Leads Earn More Than Those with Female Leads."

The movie data is from [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com) (result data was licensed under CC-BY 4.0.) Note that raw processing cannot be reproduced since that data is not included.
